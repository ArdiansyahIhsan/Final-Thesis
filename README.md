# **Consumer Purchasing Patterns in Ice Cream and Beverage Sales Transactions Using Association Learning Methods (FP-Growth)**  
This project aims to analyze consumer purchasing patterns on sales transactions of ice cream and beverage products using the Association Learning method. The main technique used is FP-Growth Algorithm, which enables the identification of relationships between products based on transaction data. Through this project, it is expected to find association rules that are useful in developing marketing strategies, increasing sales, and optimizing product layouts.  
## **Goals:**  
1. Discover consumer buying patterns from sales transaction data.
2. Identify products that are often purchased together to improve product bundling strategies.
3. Analyze relationships between products with association rules based on support, confidence, and lift metrics.
4. Assist business decision-making with relevant product recommendations.
5. Develop visualization of results in the form of tables and graphs to facilitate analysis.  
## **Insight Dependency:**  
1. Products with a high level of associative confidence, which indicates the tendency of customers to buy certain products together.
2. Products that have the highest level of support, which indicates the most popular products.
3. Relationship between products with a lift value > 1, which indicates a positive relationship between two products.
## **Advice:**  
1. Use a large enough transaction dataset so that the association rules generated are more representative.
2. Determine the optimal minimum support and confidence values, so that the rules generated are relevant without too much noise.
3. Visualize purchasing patterns to make it easier for marketing and management teams to understand.
4. Use the analysis results for business strategies, such as product recommendations, bundling promotions, or stock management.
